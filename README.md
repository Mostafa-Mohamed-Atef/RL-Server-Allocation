# Project: Optimal Server Allocation using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to determine the optimal number of servers to use in a client-server environment under varying demand levels. The goal is to balance resource usage, ensuring that the system is neither over-provisioned (wasting resources) nor under-provisioned (leading to poor performance). The project involves creating a simulator for the client-server environment, developing an RL agent, integrating the agent with the simulator, and evaluating its performance against other policies.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Project Setup and Research
**Objective**: Set up the project environment and conduct initial research on Reinforcement Learning and client-server systems.

  - Set up the development environment (Python, necessary libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym).
  - Conduct literature review on Reinforcement Learning algorithms and their applications in resource management.
  - Research client-server architectures and network protocols.
  - Identify relevant ethical considerations and engineering standards (e.g., RFC 1856).

- **Deliverables**:
  - Project environment setup.
  - Literature review report.
  - Initial project plan and timeline.

### Milestone 2: Develop Client-Server Environment Simulator
**Objective**: Create a simulator that models the client-server environment and captures demand fluctuations.

- **Tasks**:
  - Design the architecture of the simulator.
  - Implement the simulator to model server load and client requests.
  - Validate the simulator by testing with different demand scenarios.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional client-server environment simulator.
  - Documentation on simulator design and usage.

### Milestone 3: Develop Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
**Objective**: Design and implement an RL algorithm to determine the optimal number of servers.

- **Tasks**:
  - Choose an appropriate RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, DQN, Policy Gradient).
  - Implement the RL algorithm in the development environment.
  - Train the RL agent using the simulator.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional RL algorithm.
  - Initial training results and performance metrics.

### Milestone 4: Integrate RL Agent with Simulator
**Objective**: Integrate the developed RL agent with the client-server environment simulator.

- **Tasks**:
  - Modify the simulator to interact with the RL agent.
  - Implement the reward function based on server usage and demand satisfaction.
  - Test the integrated system with various demand scenarios.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Integrated RL agent and simulator.
  - Documentation on integration process and testing results.

### Milestone 5: Evaluate and Compare RL Agent Performance
**Objective**: Evaluate the performance of the RL agent and compare it with other suboptimal policies.

- **Tasks**:
  - Develop baseline policies for comparison (e.g., fixed number of servers, heuristic-based policies).
  - Conduct performance evaluation using metrics such as resource usage, demand satisfaction, and response time.
  - Analyze results and identify areas for improvement.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Performance evaluation report.
  - Comparison with baseline policies.
  - Recommendations for further improvements.

### Milestone 6: Final Documentation and Presentation
**Objective**: Prepare final documentation and present the project findings.

- **Tasks**:
  - Compile all project documentation, including design, implementation, and evaluation details.
  - Prepare a presentation summarizing the project objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
  - Address any feedback and make final adjustments to the project.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Final project report.
  - Presentation slides.
  - Updated codebase with all improvements.

## Prerequisites
- **Courses**: Probabilistic Methods in Electrical and Computer Engineering (CE302/EE302), Programming skills (CE 264 and CE364), Introduction to Computer Communication Networks (CE463).
- **Skills**: Proficiency in Python, understanding of Reinforcement Learning, knowledge of client-server architectures, and simulation development.

## Ethical Considerations
- Conserve network resources to reduce power consumption and CO2 footprint.
- Ensure the RL agent's decisions do not negatively impact system performance or user experience.

## Expected Output
- A functional Multi-server Policy RL agent.
- A simulator of a client-server environment.
- Integration between the RL agent and the simulator.
- Evaluation of the RL agent's policy and comparison with other policies.

By following these milestones, the project will systematically progress from initial research and setup to the final evaluation and presentation of a robust RL-based solution for optimal server allocation.
